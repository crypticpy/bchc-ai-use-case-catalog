## Problem

We convene a regional preparedness coalition of about 20 partner organizations — shelters, clinics, mutual aid groups, emergency management. Meetings ran monthly and notes went out roughly two weeks later, written by whichever staff member had capacity. By then partners had forgotten what they agreed to, and the same items were carried forward for three or four meetings before anyone acted on them.

## What we built

There is no software here to install. This is a written process that uses transcription and drafting features already included in our existing workspace licenses, plus a template and a rule about who approves what.

The meeting is recorded with everyone's knowledge, using the consent notice linked above, which is read at the top of every call. The transcript is generated automatically. A staff member then asks the assistant for a draft action list in the shape of our template: action, owning organization, due date, and whether it is new or carried forward from a previous list.

## How it works

Three rules make this work and all three came from getting it wrong first.

Actions are assigned to organizations, never to named individuals. Partner staff turn over, and an action assigned to a person disappears when that person leaves.

Carried-forward items are matched against the previous list before drafting, so the coalition can see how long something has been open. That column changed behaviour more than anything else we did.

The chair reads and edits the draft before it goes out. Nothing is sent automatically, and the sent version is the chair's, not the assistant's.

## Results

Action lists now reach partners the day after the meeting rather than two weeks later. Items open for more than two meetings dropped by about half over six months, which we attribute mostly to the carry-forward column being visible to everyone.

The staff time to produce a list fell from around three hours to about 40 minutes, most of which is now the chair's editing.

## Lessons learned

The first drafts read as a summary of the conversation rather than a list of commitments. Asking for the template shape explicitly — and giving the assistant the previous list — is what turned it into something useful.

Say what you are doing with the recording, out loud, at every meeting. Partners were fine with it; they were not fine with finding out later.

## How to reuse

Take the template and the three rules and run them with whatever transcription your organization already licenses. The playbook is short by design, and the recording notice is the part we would copy first.
