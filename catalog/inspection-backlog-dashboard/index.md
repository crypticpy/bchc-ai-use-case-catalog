## Problem

Every Monday, a supervisor exported four reports from the inspections system, merged them in a spreadsheet, and produced the backlog picture for the operations meeting. It took most of a morning, the numbers occasionally disagreed with each other, and nobody could look at the backlog between meetings. Our internal estimate for building a proper dashboard was four months of a developer's time, which meant it was never going to be scheduled.

## What we built

An ordinary internal dashboard: a nightly job that reads the inspections database, a set of SQL views, and a Dash application on a server we already run. It shows open and past-due counts, breakdowns by district and inspection type, and a filterable list supervisors use to reassign work.

There is no model in the running system. The dashboard does arithmetic and draws bars. What is worth sharing is how it got built.

## How it works

One developer built it in three weeks using an AI coding assistant for most of the code: the SQL views, the chart components, the layout, and the test fixtures. The developer wrote the data dictionary and the definition of "past due" by hand, in a meeting with the supervisors, before any code existed. That definition turned out to be the hard part of the project — three teams had three different ideas of when an inspection is late.

Every generated change went through the same review as any other code: a pull request, a human read of the diff, and a test run against a copy of production data. The build notes linked above describe what we let the assistant do unsupervised (component scaffolding, tests, refactors) and what we did not (schema changes, anything touching the write path, access rules).

## Results

Three weeks against a four-month estimate, with the caveat that the estimate was made for a team that would have designed a data warehouse first. The dashboard replaced four spreadsheets and the Monday morning merge.

Backlog is now reviewed weekly instead of monthly, and past-due work in the worst district dropped by about a fifth over the first quarter as supervisors reassigned it earlier.

## Lessons learned

The assistant was fastest at exactly the code we would have found tedious and slowest to be trusted with anything requiring institutional knowledge. It confidently produced a "days past due" calculation that ignored the statutory grace period, which a reviewer caught because the definition had been written down first.

Write the definitions before you write the prompts.

## How to reuse

The code is specific to our schema and is not published, but the build notes are the reusable part: what to review, what to hand over, and the argument we used to get an AI-assisted build approved by our IT governance group.
