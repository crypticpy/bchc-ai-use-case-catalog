## Problem

Onboarding a new employee involved six people sending overlapping emails. HR sent forms, IT sent an account notice, the supervisor sent a schedule, building services sent badge instructions, and the new hire pieced it together. Nothing tracked what had actually been done. New inspectors regularly reached their second week without database access, and our service desk logged about 11 tickets per new hire in the first week — almost all of them "where do I find" or "who approves this".

## What we built

A checklist app on our low-code platform, plus a chat assistant that answers questions from published internal policy pages.

When HR marks a position filled, the app builds a checklist from a task library keyed to role, start date and work location. A field inspector gets vehicle and tablet tasks; an analyst does not. The app opens the access requests it is allowed to open, routes each to the right approver, and shows the new hire and the supervisor the same list.

## How it works

The task library is a spreadsheet HR maintains — about 90 tasks with rules for when each applies. That spreadsheet, not the model, decides what appears on a checklist.

The assistant is a retrieval assistant over our handbook, IT policies and the access catalog. It answers only from those pages and shows the section it used. It is explicitly out of scope for anything about pay, classification, discipline or personnel records, and it says so rather than guessing. Out-of-scope questions are logged, which turned out to be a useful list for HR.

Every access request still needs a human approval. The assistant drafts and tracks; it does not grant.

## Results

First-week help desk tickets fell from 11 to 3 per new hire. Time from start date to full system access dropped from a median of nine days to three. Supervisors report the biggest change is simply being able to see what is outstanding without asking.

## Lessons learned

The rules belong in the spreadsheet, not the prompt. Every time we let the model decide which tasks applied, it produced a reasonable-looking checklist that was subtly wrong for someone. Keeping the logic where HR can read and edit it made the tool defensible and easy to hand over.

## How to reuse

The runbook walks through the build in the order we did it: task library first, checklist app second, assistant last. Doing the assistant first is tempting and wrong — the checklist alone delivered most of the benefit, and it works without any AI at all.
