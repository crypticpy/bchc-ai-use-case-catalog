## Problem

Our procurement team of three reviews around 200 vendor agreements a year. Many arrive as scanned PDFs from vendors who redlined a printout. The first pass — reading the whole document, finding the clauses that differ from our standard terms, and noticing the clauses that are missing entirely — took a specialist most of a week per contract, and missing clauses were the ones most often missed.

## What we built

We licensed a commercial contract review product rather than building anything. The vendor's tool reads the scanned agreement, extracts clauses, writes a plain-language summary of each, and compares them against a library of our own standard terms that we uploaded during setup.

The output is a review worksheet: one row per clause, with the page it came from, a summary, and a flag saying whether it matches our template, differs, or is absent.

## How it works

Scanned pages go through optical character recognition first, which is why quality varies with the scan. The comparison is against our own clause library — the tool is only as useful as the standard terms you give it, and getting ours into a consistent shape took longer than the vendor implementation.

Nothing is decided by the tool. A contracts specialist opens every flagged clause in the source document before it goes anywhere. The tool changes what gets read first, not what gets approved.

## Results

Across 38 contracts in the pilot, first-pass review dropped from a median of five business days to one. The tool found two missing clauses per contract on average — usually records retention or right to audit — which is the result that actually persuaded our leadership, since those were the gaps that previously surfaced after signature.

Accuracy on badly scanned documents was noticeably worse. Roughly one in six contracts needed a page rescanned before the extraction was usable.

## Lessons learned

Budget for the standard terms library. Ours existed as a Word document with twelve years of comments in it, and normalizing it was three weeks of work that we would have had to do eventually anyway.

Ask the vendor where documents are processed and what is retained, in writing, before the pilot. Our agreement covers processing location, retention period and a prohibition on training against our documents.

## How to reuse

This is a paid product on the vendor's infrastructure, so the path is procurement rather than deployment. The evaluation memo linked above is the document we used to make the case — it lists the questions we asked the vendor and the answers, which is probably more reusable than anything else here.
