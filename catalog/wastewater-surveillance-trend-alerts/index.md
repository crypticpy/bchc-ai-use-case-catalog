We started posting wastewater trends by hand in 2024 and kept missing rises that were obvious in hindsight. The alerting version fits a seasonal baseline per plant and per target, flags a sustained two-sample rise above the baseline's expected band, and drafts a three-sentence note an epidemiologist approves before it posts. The human approval step matters: about one flag in five is a sampling artifact, and the reviewer catches those in under a minute.

Setup for another jurisdiction means pointing the ingest at your lab export, setting plant service-area names, and two seasons of history for the baseline. The alert prompt is in the repo and is deliberately boring — it summarizes numbers the model computed, it never speculates about causes.
