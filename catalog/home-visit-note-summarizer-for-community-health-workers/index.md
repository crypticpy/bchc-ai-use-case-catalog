summary: "Community health workers record a short voice memo after each home visit; the tool transcribes it, drafts the structured visit note in our case-management format, and queues it for the CHW to review and file — turning a 20-minute typing task into a 4-minute review."
impact: "Visit notes filed same-day rose from 54% to 93% in the eight-week pilot"

Our CHWs were spending the last 90 minutes of every field day typing notes, and same-day filing kept slipping. The pilot gave twelve CHWs a one-button voice memo flow: record in the parking lot, get the drafted note back before you're at the next visit, fix what's wrong, file it.

Two design choices did the most work. The draft opens with the three fields our nurses actually search on (referral made, follow-up date, safety flag), so a rushed review still gets the load-bearing fields right. And the tool refuses to file anything itself — a CHW taps file, every time. In the exit survey, eleven of twelve CHWs asked to keep it after the pilot.
